# 1315 Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent

## 💻 Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with an even-valued grandparent. If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return `0`.

A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent if it exists.

**Example 1**

```
Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.
```
