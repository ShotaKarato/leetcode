# 1669 Merge In Between Linked Lists

## ðŸ’» Description

You are given two linked lists: `list1` and `list2` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively.

Remove `list1`'s nodes from the `ath` node to the `bth` node, and put `list2` in their place.

**Example 1**

```
Input: list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
Output: [10,1,13,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]
Explanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
```
