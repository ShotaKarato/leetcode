# 2181 Merge Nodes in Between Zeros

## 💻 Description

You are given the `head` of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by `0`'s. The beginning and end of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For every two consecutive `0`'s, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any `0`'s.

Return the `head` of the modified linked list.

**Example 1**

```
Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
Output: [4,11]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.
```
