# 27 Remove Element

## 💻 Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
Return `k`.

**Example 1**

```
Input: `nums` = [3,2,2,3], `val` = 3
Output: 2, `nums` = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return `k` = 2, with the first two elements of `nums` being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).
```
