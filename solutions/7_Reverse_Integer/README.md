# 7 Reverse Integer

## 💻 Description

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^ 31, 2^ 31 - 1], then return `0`.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

**Example 1**

```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```
