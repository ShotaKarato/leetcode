# 86 Partition List

## ðŸ’» Description

Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes less than `x` come before nodes greater than or equal to `x`.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example 1**

```
Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
```
