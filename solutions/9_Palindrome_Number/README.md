# 9 Palindrome Number

## 💻 Description

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1**

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```
